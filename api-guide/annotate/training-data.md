# Training Data

AI requires high quality training data. Training data is used to "teach" AI models how to understand the world. Models

## Quality and quantity

## Organize your data in a way that AI can understand

A training set refers to the data that is used as positive inputs for concepts in a model. A “good” training set will set the model to make predictions as closely to the world as the user sees it as possible.  

Data quality

1) Visually adheres to concept descriptions laid out in a taxonomy.
2) Reflects the expected user’s data for model’s intended use case.

Data quantity

More data means more examples from your model to learn from.



Example: For Guinness Beer’s “Perfect Pint” model, the client had a few thousand images of professionally photographed pints of beer in different stages of pour appearance on bar tops, taken in daylight. The model was meant to see a photo of a pint of beer, and return a judgement on how the pint of beer looks compared to the “perfect” looking pint of beer.

Unfortunately, because the images used to initially train the model did not look qualitatively similar to the user generated data and the user data was photographed in more scenarios than bars, the model needed improvement in the form of 1) more data to capture the breadth of scenarios, and 2) data that reflected the quality of smartphone cameras. After applying these changes, the model performance improved.
