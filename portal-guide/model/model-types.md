# Model Types

This page describes some important model types that you should know when working with the Clarifai platform. Please keep in mind that this is an overview of the general categories of models available to you. New models are created all the time. For the most up-to-date list of available models, visit Model Mode in Portal.

## Classification

Classification is the most important model type to know about. Predicts and then assigns classification of an object | “This is an image of a giraffe”

Example Use Case:

A large retailer looking to find and remove listings for illegal objects and substances across thousands of listings that include user-generated data. A detection model allows the retailer to quickly find listings that are in violation of their community rules, and remove them from the site.

## Detection

Given a scenario, allows a user to find an object or image. Requires bounding box data | “The giraffe is located at xyz point in the image”

Detection models only apply to visual models.

## Embedding

The "learnings" from machine learning models can be saved and transferred to new models, or used for other forms of visual analysis. This is what the Embedding model type is all about. Embeddings can provide the foundations for new custom models, or can be used to power visual search.

## Deep Trained Models



## Models that modify, connect or extend other models

### Context-Based Classifier

The context-based classifier

### Cluster

Allows a user to detect an object or subject in different scenarios and settings, and then define the object. DST is not required for training these kinds of models because they are built by our Field Engineering and Backend teams. | “I will use this image of a giraffe to find other giraffes”



### Fixed-Function Operators
