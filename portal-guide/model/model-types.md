# Model Types

This page describes some important model types that you should know when working with the Clarifai platform. Please keep in mind that this is an overview of the general categories of models available to you. New models are created all the time, and for the most up-to-date list of available models, visit Model Mode in Portal.

## Classification

Classification is the most important model type to know about. Predicts and then assigns classification of an object | “This is an image of a giraffe”

e created a model for a large resale retailer looking to find and remove listings for illegal objects and substances across thousands of listings with UGC data. A detection model allows that retailer to quickly find listings that breach their contract, and remove them from the site.

## Detection

Given a scenario, allows a user to find an object or image. Requires bounding box data | “The giraffe is located at xyz point in the image”

## Embedding


## Deep Trained Models



## Models that modify, connect or extend other models

### Context-Based Classifier

The context-based classifier

### Cluster

Allows a user to detect an object or subject in different scenarios and settings, and then define the object. DST is not required for training these kinds of models because they are built by our Field Engineering and Backend teams. | “I will use this image of a giraffe to find other giraffes”
