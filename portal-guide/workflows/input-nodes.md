The outputs from one workflow can be used as the inputs in another workflow. This allows you to link together the models in a graph. This ability to link together models is the key to building targeted AI solutions.

## Supported input and output types

To view your available models, just open your app and click Model Mode icon on the left hand side of the screen. From here just click the Create a Custom Model button in the top righthand corner of the screen.

Different models accept different types of inputs and return different types of outputs

#### Inputs

* Concept
* Image
* Image and video
* Text

#### Outputs

* Cluster
* Color
* Concept
* Concepts
* Embed
* Region with concept
* Region with embed
* Region masks with concepts
* Region with text
* Region with image

## The building blocks

You can create workflows out of any custom models that you have created for your app. The inputs and outputs supported by your custom models will depend on the inputs and outputs supported by the Clarifai models that you have used to build them. Clarifai models support different inputs and outputs depending on how they are designed and what they are used for.
