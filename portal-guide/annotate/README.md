# Labeler

Annotations \(also known as "labels"\) are how you prepare training data to "teach" your models to recognize new concepts. Labeled training data is a key ingredient to any custom AI solution.

Clarifai Labeler offers custom tools for labeling image and video datasets, and helps you delegate and manage labeling projects of any size.
