# Saved Searches

Saving searches helps you to make your model tests reproducible.

With saved searches you can capture your search results at a given point in time, and record the inputs, annotations, search parameters and models that you are running through the platform.

Saved searches are extremely helpful when testing out multiple versions of a model, or collaborating with a team. Just save your search, and refer back to it any time.

### Preserve Search Results

You have the option to preserve the current search results as they are. Adding or annotating new inputs will not affect these results. However, deleting inputs from the app will remove them from the search results.

## Access your search any time

You can access your saved search by navigating to the "Saved Searches" section at the top of the sidebar.
